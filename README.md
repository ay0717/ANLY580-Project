# ANLY580_Project

As global networks rapidly develop, more and more industries are moving their businesses online. Customers can purchase products, book tickets and hotels, and even pick favorite restaurants through online applications. User-generated online reviews become one of the most important references for customers making purchase decisions. Unfortunately, among online reviews, a portion of them are deceptive. These reviews are deliberately written to sound authentic and misleads customers into making purchase decisions. In order to solve this problem, our team proposes to employ supervised machine learning algorithms to detect deceptive opinion spam, specifically we are interested in building a classifier that detects spam hotel reviews and separates those from truthful ones. Our team will build several machine learning classification models and evaluate the performance of each classifier.
